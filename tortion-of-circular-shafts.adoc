== Tortion of Circular Shafts 

Torsion is the twisting of an object caused by a moment acting about the object's longitudinal axis. **Torque** is the moment that causes the twisting. 

Consider a shaft transmitting power.

Where stem:[T] is the applied torque, stem:[L] is the length of the bar, stem:[G] is the **shear modulus**, and stem:[J] is the **polar moment of inertia**. The value of stem:[G] can be obtained using an experiment.

* The polar moment of inertia describes a cross-section's resistance to torsion due to its shape. The polar moment of inertia for a hollow bar shown below can be calculated as follows.

For a solid circular bar, stem:[J = \frac{\pi}{2} \big( r^4 \big)]

[NOTE]
====
A moment of stem:[1500\ Nm] is acting on a solid cylinder shaft with diameter stem:[150\ mm] and length stem:[2\ m]. The shaft is made in steel with modulus of rigidity stem:[79\ GPa].

(a) Calculate the angular deflection of the shaft. 
(b) Assuming the shaft is hollow with an inner diameter of stem:[50\ mm], calculate the angular deflection of the shaft.
