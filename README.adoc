== Introduction 

latexmath:[Stress (\Gamma) = \frac{P (load)}{A (area)}]


[NOTE]
.What will be total extension of the bar?
====
Determine the stress in each section of the bar shown in the figure 1 below when subjected to an axial tensile load of 20kN. The central section is 30 mm square cross-section; the other portions are of circular section, their diameters being indicated. What will be the total extension of the bar? For the bar material E = 210 stem:[GN/m^2]
