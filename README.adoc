[NOTE]
.What will be total extension of the bar?
====
Determine the stress in each section of the bar shown in the figure 1 below when subjected to an axial tensile load of 20kN. The central section is 30 mm square cross-section; the other portions are of circular section, their diameters being indicated. What will be the total extension of the bar? For the bar material E = 210 stem:[GN/m^2]
====

[NOTE]
.Determine the modulus of elasticity for the bar material.
====
* A 25 mm diameter bar is subjected to an axial tensile load of 100 kN. Under the action of this load a 200 mm gauge length is found to extend 0.19*10^-3 mm. Determine the modulus of elasticity for the bar material. 
* If, in order to reduce weight whilst keeping the external diameter constant, the bar is bored axially to produce a cylinder of uniform thickness, what is the maximum diameter of bore possible given that the maximum allowable stress is 240 MN/m^2? The load can be assumed to remain constant at 100 kN. 
* What will be the change in the outside diameter of the bar under the limiting stress quoted above? (E = 210 GN/m^2 and v = 0.3)
