== Simple Stress and Strain

TIP: This section covers idealized simple stress and strain. In more complex cases, some of these simplifications may not apply. 

=== Loading

Components of engineering structures or mechanisms experience various forces. For example, the cylindrical bar below is used in a lifting mechanism and so it is subjected to *tension* force along the axis. 

A member of a mechanism may experience loading in one of the following ways. 

[%hardbreaks]
(a) Static, dead, or non-fluctuating loads e.g. force due to gravity
(b) Live loads e.g. train on the railway 
(c) Impact or shock loads e.g. hammering 
(d) Fatigue, fluctuating, or altering loads e.g. repeated loaded swivel, crack propagation 

=== Direct or Normal Stress (stem:[\sigma])

This is when a uniform-structured member or a bar is subjected to #*uniform* tension or compression#. 

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
\sigma\ (\text{stress}) = \frac{F\ (\text{load})}{A\ (\text{area})}\ \frac{N}{m^2}
++++
====

=== Direct or Normal Strain (stem:[\epsilon])

This is a dimensionless measure of a change in length of a member, after it has been subjected to tension or compression. 

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
\epsilon\ (\text{strain}) = \frac{\Delta L\ (\text{change in length})}{L\ (\text{original length})}\ \frac{\cancel{m}}{\cancel{m}}
++++
====

Strain may be expressed as a percentage, stem:[\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L} \times 100 \%].
Tensile stress and strain are considered positive, while compressive ones are considered negative. 

=== Elastic Materials (Hooke's Law, stem:[F = ke])

A member is said to be elastic or obey Hooke's law if it returns to its original length when the load is withdrawn. In this case, the stress is proportional to strain. 

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} = constant
++++
====

Common classification of materials:
[%hardbreaks]
Homogeneous material -- uniform structure without any flaws or discontinuities e.g. steel
Inhomogeneous material -- the structure varies from point to point e.g. concrete, some cast iron 
Isotropic -- uniform properties throughout in all directions 
Anisotropic -- varying properties 
Othotropic -- different properties in different planes e.g. wood, some composites  

Here, we assume homogeneous materials with isotropic properties. 

=== Modulus of Elasticity (Young's Modulus, stem:[E])

The constant derived above, within which Hooke's law applies, is referred to as the _modulus of elasticity_ or the _Young's modulus_, *E*.

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} = E
++++

[stem]
++++
E = \frac{F}{A}/ \frac{\Delta L}{L} = \frac{FL}{A \Delta L}
++++
====

The modulus of elasticity is assumed to be the same, both in tension or in compression. Since its value is large for most engineering materials, stem:[~ \times 10^9 N/m^2], the strain will be small, stem:[~ 0.3\%]. Usually, the deformations are typically small with respect to the original dimension. 

=== Tensile Test 

The modulus of elasticity is determined by carrying out a standard test as shown in the figure below. In this test, a circular bar of a uniform cross-section is subjected to a gradually increasing tensile load until failure occurs. The #change in the *gauge length*# is recorded as the loading operation continues. 

[#img-tensileTest] 
.Tensile test.

image::tensileTest.png[tensileTest,width=100%,align="left"] 

[%hardbreaks]
#Origin to point *A*:# _Hooke's law_ is obeyed. Stress is proportional to strain.
#At point *A*:# _limit of proportionality_ 
#Between points *A* and *B*:# the material may still be elastic but Hooke's law is not obeyed. 
#At point *B*:# _elastic limit_ 
In most practical cases, points *A* and *B* are coincident. 
#Beyond point *B*:# _plastic deformation_ 
Strains are not totally recoverable and permanent deformations are recorded when load is removed. 
#At point *C*:# _upper yield point_ 
#At point *D*:# _lower yield point_ 
A rapid increase in strain occurs without a corresponding increase in stress. 
#Between points *E* and *F*:# _necking_ occurs 
The stress reaches the maximum value, the _ultimate tensile strength_.
#At point *F*:# the specimen breaks 

[%hardbreaks]
* The *ductility* is the capacity of a material to allow large plastic deformations.
* For some materials, say, non-ferrous and high-carbon steel, the difference between points C and D cannot be detected. In such cases, a *proof stress* is used to show the onset of plastic strain.  

=== Poisson's Ratio (stem:[v])

When a bar is subjected to a tension load, it experiences an increase in length, stem:[\Delta L], giving a longitudinal strain in the bar, stem:[\epsilon_{Long}].

[stem]
++++
\epsilon_{Long} = \frac{\Delta L}{L}
++++

The breath, stem:[b], and the depth, stem:[d], of the bar will also reduce, thereby altering the lateral dimensions of the bar. The lateral strain, stem:[\epsilon_{Lat}], can be given by the following equation. 

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
\epsilon_{Lat} = - \frac{\Delta b}{b} = - \frac{\Delta d}{d}
++++

[stem]
++++
v (\text{Poisson's ratio}) = \frac{\epsilon_{Lat}}{\epsilon_{Long}} = - \frac{\Delta d}{d} \times \frac{L}{\Delta L}
++++

[stem]
++++
\epsilon_{Long} = \frac{\sigma_{Long}}{E} = \frac{\sigma}{E}
++++

[stem]
++++
\epsilon_{Lat} = v \times \frac{\sigma}{E}
++++
====

=== Modulus of Rigidity (stem:[G])

==== Shear Stress (stem:[\tau])

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
\tau (\text{shear stress}) = \frac{F (\text{shear load})}{A (\text{area resisting shear})}
++++

[stem]
++++
\tau (\text{in double shear stress}) = \frac{F}{2 \times A }
++++
====

==== Shear Strain (stem:[\gamma])

[stem]
++++
\gamma = \frac{\Delta L}{L}
++++

* The *modulus of rigidity*, stem:[G], or *shear modulus* is comparable to modulus of elasticity and it is calculated as follows. 

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
G = \frac{\tau}{\gamma} = \text{constant}
++++
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Before attempting a question, make sure you understand the fundamental concept. Draw sketches where necessary. Make sure you #derive your equations# correctly, then substitute the values. This is useful in preparing a general algorithm and reducing approximation errors. 
* Your answers should be in SI units and scientific notation. Use the following form #stem:[p.qrs \times 10^t] `units`#. Where stem:[p,q,r,s] is a number between stem:[0-9], stem:[t] is a signed integer, and `units` is the relevant SI units. This is useful in establishing a quick objective meaning of size/scale.

// (a) An aluminium rod of 20 mm diameter is completely enclosed in a steel tube of 30 mm external
// diameter and both the ends of the assembly are rigidly connected. If the composite bar is heated
// through 50°C, find the stresses developed in the aluminium rod and steel tube. Take:
// [%hardbreaks]
// Modulus of elasticity for steel = 200 GPa
// Modulus of elasticity for aluminium = 80 GPa
// Coefficient of expansion for steel = 12 × 10–6/°C
// Coefficient of expansion for aluminium = 18 × 10–6/°C

// (b) A steel rod of 10 mm diameter passes centrally through a copper tube of external diameter 40
// mm and internal diameter 30 mm. The assembly is tightened with the help of washers and nuts.
// If the whole assembly is heated through 60°C, then find the stresses developed in the steel rod
// and copper tube. Assume :
// [%hardbreaks]
// Young’s modulus for steel = 200 GPa
// Young’s modulus for copper = 100 GPa
// Coefficient of expansion for steel = 11.5 × 10–6 /°C
// Coefficient of expansion for copper = 17 × 10–6 /°C
