== Simple Stress and Strain

=== Theory 

TIP: This section covers idealized simple stress and strain. In more complex cases, some of these simplifications may not apply. 

==== Loading

Components of engineering structures or mechanisms experience various forces. For example, the cylindrical bar below is used in a lifting mechanism and so it is subjected to *tension* force along the axis. 

A member of a mechanism may experience loading in one of the following ways. 

[%hardbreaks]
(a) Static, dead, or non-fluctuating loads e.g. force due to gravity
(b) Live loads e.g. train on the railway 
(c) Impact or shock loads e.g. hammering 
(d) Fatigue, fluctuating, or altering loads e.g. repeated loaded swivel, crack propagation 

==== Direct or Normal Stress (stem:[\sigma])

This is when a uniform-structured member or a bar is subjected to #*uniform* tension or compression#. 

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
\sigma\ (\text{stress}) = \frac{F\ (\text{load})}{A\ (\text{area})}\ \frac{N}{m^2}
++++
====

==== Direct or Normal Strain (stem:[\epsilon])

This is a dimensionless measure of a change in length of a member, after it has been subjected to tension or compression. 

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
\epsilon\ (\text{strain}) = \frac{\Delta L\ (\text{change in length})}{L\ (\text{original length})}\ \frac{\cancel{m}}{\cancel{m}}
++++
====

Strain may be expressed as a percentage, stem:[\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L} \times 100 \%].
Tensile stress and strain are considered positive, while compressive ones are considered negative. 

==== Elastic Materials (Hooke's Law stem:[F = ke])

A member is said to be elastic or obey Hooke's law if it returns to its original length when the load is withdrawn. In this case, the stress is proportional to strain. 

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} = constant
++++
====

Common classification of materials:
[%hardbreaks]
Homogeneous material -- uniform structure without any flaws or discontinuities e.g. steel
Inhomogeneous material -- the structure varies from point to point e.g. concrete, some cast iron 
Isotropic -- uniform properties throughout in all directions 
Anisotropic -- varying properties 
Othotropic -- different properties in different planes e.g. wood, some composites  

Here, we assume homogeneous materials with isotropic properties. 

==== Modulus of Elasticity (Young's Modulus, stem:[E])

The constant derived above, within which Hooke's law applies, is referred to as the _modulus of elasticity_ or the _Young's modulus_, *E*.

[TIP]
====
[stem]
++++
\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} = E
++++

[stem]
++++
E = \frac{F}{A}/ \frac{\Delta L}{L} = \frac{FL}{A \Delta L}
++++

=== Examples

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Make sure you understand the concept. Draw sketches where necessary. Make sure you #derive your equations# correctly, then substitute the values. This is useful in preparing the general algorithm and reducing approximations. 
* Your answers should be in SI units and scientific notation. Use the following form #stem:[p.qrs \times 10^t] `units`#. Where stem:[p,q,r,s] is a number between stem:[0-9], stem:[t] is a signed integer, and `units` is the relevant SI units. This is useful in establishing a quick objective meaning of size/scale.

==== A bar with various cross-sections 
[NOTE]
====
A sectional bar of stem:[E = 210 GN/m^2] is subjected to an axial tensile load of stem:[F_1 = F_2 = 25kN]. The circular section stem:[C_{s1}] has a diameter of stem:[25 mm]. Square cross-section of dimension stem:[C_{s2} = 40 mm], and circular section stem:[C_{s3} = 20 mm] in diameter. stem:[L_{1} = 200 mm], stem:[L_{2} = 110 mm], stem:[L_{3} = 450 mm]

What is *the stress* in each section and *the total extension* of the sectional bar?

==== A bored circular cross-section 
[NOTE]
====
* A stem:[30 mm] diameter bar is subjected to an axial tensile load of stem:[115 kN]. Under the action of this load a stem:[200 mm] gauge length is found to extend stem:[0.15 \times 10^{-3} mm]. Determine the modulus of elasticity for the bar material. 
* To reduce weight whilst keeping the external diameter constant, the bar is bored axially to produce a cylinder of uniform thickness, what is the maximum diameter of bore possible given that the maximum allowable stress is stem:[245 MN/m^2]? The load can be assumed to remain constant at stem:[115 kN]. 
* What will be the change in the outside diameter of the bar under the limiting stress quoted above? (stem:[E = 210 GN/m^2] and stem:[v = 0.3])

stem:[F_3 = F_4 = 25 kN]
stem:[W_1 = 55 mm]
stem:[T_1 = T_2 = T_3 = 7 mm]

(b) the direct stress in the plate;
(c) the direct stress in the forked end of the coupling.

given quarter of a turn. The bolt is single-threaded with 2 mm pitch. Find the stress in the bolt and the tube. What is the tensile force that must be applied to the assembly so that the stress in the tube is zero? E for aluminium = 70 GPa and E for brass = 100GPa.
