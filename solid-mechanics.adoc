== Introduction 

=== Simple Stress and Strain

Your answers should be in SI units and the form stem:[p.qrs \times 10^t]. Where stem:[p,q,r,s] is a number between stem:[0,9] and stem:[t] is a signed integer.

==== A bar with various cross-sections 
[NOTE]
====
A sectional bar of stem:[E = 210 GN/m^2] is subjected to an axial tensile load of stem:[F_1 = F_2 = 25kN]. The circular section stem:[C_{s1}] has a diameter of stem:[25 mm]. Square cross-section stem:[C_{s2} = 40 mm^2], and circular section stem:[C_{s3} = 20 mm] in diameter. stem:[L_{1} = 200 mm], stem:[L_{2} = 110 mm], stem:[L_{3} = 450 mm]

What is *the stress* in each section and *the total extension* of the sectional bar?

==== A bored circular cross-section 
[NOTE]
====
* A stem:[25 mm] diameter bar is subjected to an axial tensile load of stem:[100 kN]. Under the action of this load a stem:[200 mm] gauge length is found to extend stem:[0.19 \times 10^-3 mm]. Determine the modulus of elasticity for the bar material. 
* To reduce weight whilst keeping the external diameter constant, the bar is bored axially to produce a cylinder of uniform thickness, what is the maximum diameter of bore possible given that the maximum allowable stress is stem:[240 MN/m^2]? The load can be assumed to remain constant at stem:[100 kN]. 
* What will be the change in the outside diameter of the bar under the limiting stress quoted above? (stem:[E = 210 GN/m^2] and stem:[v = 0.3])

==== A stressed coupling 
[NOTE]
====
The coupling shown below is constructed from steel of a rectangular cross-section and is designed to transmit a tensile force of stem:[50 kN]. If the bolt is of stem:[15 mm] diameter calculate:

[%hardbreaks]
(a) the shear stress in the bolt;
(b) the direct stress in the plate;
(c) the direct stress in the forked end of the coupling.

==== Extension of tapered bar 
[NOTE]
====
Derive an expression for the total extension of the tapered bar of the circular cross-section shown below when it is subjected to an axial tensile load stem:[W].
